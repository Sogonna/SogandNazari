## Sogand Nazari (Sogonna)
Software developer and problem solver working with a self-directed model of learning and developing real world products.
I have used my own model of self-directed learning to find and solve different types of technical problems using development methods such as testing hypotheses and iteratively finding practical solutions.
I develop projects to test technical approaches and to organize code to best implement real-world solutions to complex problems. My projects reflect my continued use of structured problem-solving techniques, maintainable code and continuing improvement in both computational skills and analytical skills.
## Current Work
- Front end web applications based upon React and focusing on component structure, state management and maintainability  - Fundamentals of JavaScript and front-end system design  - Use of Python for analytical workflow and backend logic and algorithms  - Ongoing practice of algorithms, mathematics and computational problem solving via coding.
## Projects
Projects are comprised of combinations of structured course-work, client work and experimental development:
- CS50 Projects – Developed foundational programming concepts and algorithms in Python, C and web technologies.  - Hexa Platform (Front End & Back End) – Practical web application developed with client-driven constraints emphasizing usability, clean architecture and iterative improvements.  - Mathematical & Algorithmic Exercises – Self-directed problem solving to continue to strengthen computational thinking and algorithmic skills.  - Portfolio Client Project * (upcoming) – Plotted real-client development project illustrating application of front-end and back-end skills to true business requirements.
## Research
The current area of research includes an **End-to-End Machine Learning Framework** for synchronizing product innovation, market creation and distribution. This research explores how computational models can speed up decision-making and assist in the rapid launch of new products. Research is in the early stages of experimentation and prototyping.
## Development Methodology
I learn by building: choosing problems, implementing solutions, and refining choices through the hands on approach of building, under the constraints of time and resources. Each repository represents the culmination of this hands-on process - from the first experiment to the final implementation.
## Future Vision
In the long term I am interested in the intersection of **Artificial Intelligence, Product Innovation, and Computational Problem Solving**, designing systems that will use analytical reasoning, automation, and intelligent decision-making to provide scalable solutions in rapidly changing and realistic environments.
